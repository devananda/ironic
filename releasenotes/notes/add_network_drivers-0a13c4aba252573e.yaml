    Added network drivers interface. Introduce three network drivers: ``flat``,
    which is the default and replicates the flat network behavior present
    previously, ``neutron``, to be used in case of neutron being present, and
    ``none`` when neutron is not used, which is basically a noop driver. The
    network driver is used to switch network for node during
    provisioning/cleaning. Added new node field ``network_interface`` that
    allows to specify network driver to use.
deprecations:
  - create_cleaning_ports and delete_cleaning_ports via dhcp provider is
    deprecated. The network interface driver should be used instead.
upgrade:
  - Deployments not using neutron should switch the nodes to use ``none``
    network interface, as ``flat`` interface now requires
    ``[neutron]cleaning_network_uuid`` to be present in config. Also ``flat``
    interface is in the list of ``enabled_network_drivers`` by default, in case
    of non-neutron deployment, it should be changed to ``none``, as all the
    enabled interfaces are loaded on conductor startup.
